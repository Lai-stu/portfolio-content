				<h2>ANCHORAGE TO FAIRBANKS</h2>
				<h3>Discover the way to connect between Alaska’s two largest cities. They are also our main destinations</h3>
				<h3>FLYING</h3>
				<p>
					With airlines increasing flights to Alaska, competition is expected to keep fares low. Alaska Airlines will offer nonstop flights between the state and 11 American cities this summer. Delta Air Lines added new service to Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
					Flights from Anchorage to Fairbanks take less than an hour.
					If you really need to get there in one day, consider flying.

				<h3>TAKE THE TRAIN</h3>
				<p>
					Riding the Alaska Railroad from Anchorage to Fairbanks is an experience described as something like being in a movie from days gone by. For nearly 50 years, the two cities were connected solely by train, and while the route offers the same superior service and scenery of the past, it's the modern cars and many amenities that make it memorable today.
					The train trip to Fairbanks takes about 12 hours.
					Marvel in the beautiful scenery along the way, get up and walk around, and enjoy a beverage or fabulous meal
					aboard the train.
					Great service by all the staff at registration and on board the train. I highly recommend the dome train for all traveling from Anchorage to Fairbanks; there was no stress and it's safer than driving.

				<h3>DRIVE YOURSELF</h3>
				<p>
					Driving from Anchorage to Fairbanks makes for a long but doable day.
					The road is open year round. If you intend to road trip from Anchorage to Fairbanks in the winter months, be prepared for slow driving and ice and snow in the road. Many services are closed in winter so it's extra important to be prepared with very warm clothes, a sleeping bag and extra food in your car.
					Plan for seven hours of driving with an additional few hours of sightseeing and a lunch stop.
